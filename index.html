    <h2>Long-time IT Manager, Learning a few new tricks</h2>
    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>This site is VERY much a work in progress, as I'm actively working to learn a few things about modern development. To help me learn, I'm working my way through some courses on Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, React, SQL, and more. </p>
    <p>While I don't expect to be making a major pivot in my career any time soon - I'm enjoying the opportunity to flex a few new muscles.
    <p>Please, feel free to explore my projects (including "HTML 101" projects) below.</p>
