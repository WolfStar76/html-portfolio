    <h1>WolfStar76's Top 3 Movies</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, that's right - these are my top three movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2>1. The Fifth Element</h2>
    <p>
      Yeah, it's campy. And it seems to be a love/hate movie - but I, for one,
      love it.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Kingsmen</h2>
    <p>
      Movies where there's more to the world than what we normally know about
      fascinate me. A well-done sense of surrealism is a great way to "hook" me.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Almost anything Marvel</h2>
    <p>
      Yeah, I'm one of <i>those</i> nerds. I won't geek out about it at length,
      but I'm down to catch each movie in theaters.
